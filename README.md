# Washington State Environmental Justice Analysis

This is a GitHub repository for Jaslyn Miura's analysis of a socioeconomic and environmental EJ indicator in Washington, using EJScreen data.

To understand the extent of environmental justices issues in the state of Washington, the proportion of low income and the potential exposure of PM 2.5 levels were selected for this analysis. Creating a map of the two variables provides a visual to determine if there is some kind of relationship between the two issues.
